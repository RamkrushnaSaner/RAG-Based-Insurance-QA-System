# RAG-Based-Insurance-QA-System
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer questions from an insurance policy prospect using both dense embeddings and LLM-based generation. It is designed to be educational, and beginner-friendly, showing a complete RAG workflow from document ingestion to answer generation.
